<h4> <a name="CNT"></a>Topic A: Deformation mechanism of CNT fiber</h4>

<p class="justify">
Carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers exhibit high mechanical properties and possess good thermal and electrical conductivity that indicate potential as multi-functional materials. Studying the strengthening and toughening mechanisms of CNT fibers is critical to the future applications of fibers and fiber-based composites. CNT fibers are characterized by multi-level structures
including macroscopic fiber, mesoscopic bundle networks, and microscopic nanotubes.

We investigated the multi-scale deformation and interfacial mechanical behavior of CNT fibers with multi-level structures via experimental and theoretical methods. Multi-scale experiments including uniaxial tensile testing, <em>in situ</em> Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy were conducted to measure the mechanical response of multi-level structures within the fiber under tension. A two-level interfacial mechanical model was then presented to analyze the interfacial bonding strength of mesoscopic bundles and microscopic nanotubes. The evolution characteristics of multi-scale deformation of the fiber were described based on experimental characterization and interfacial strength analysis. Comprehensive analysis showed that the property of multi-level interfaces is a critical factor for the fiber strength and toughness. The result can be used to guide multi-level interface engineering of CNT fibers and fiber-based composites to produce high performance materials.
