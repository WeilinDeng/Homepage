  title={Angle-independent optimal adhesion in plane peeling of thin elastic films at large surface roughnesses},
  author={Deng, Weilin and Kesari, Haneesh},
  abstract={
    Adhesive peeling of a thin elastic film from a substrate is a classic problem in mechanics. However, many of the investigations on this topic to date have focused on peeling from substrates with flat surfaces. In this paper, we study the problem of peeling an elastic thin film from a rigid substrate that has periodic surface undulations. We allow for contact between the detached part of the film with the substrate. We give analytical results for computing the equilibrium force given the true peeling angle, which is the angle at which the detached part of the film leaves the substrate. When there is no contact we present explicit results for computing the true peeling angle from the substrate's profile and for determining an equilibrium state's stability solely from the substrate's surface curvature. The general results that we derive for the case involving contact allow us to explore the regime of peeling at large surface roughnesses. Our analysis of this regime reveals that the peel-off force can be made to become independent of the peeling direction by roughening the surface. This result is in stark contrast to results from peeling on flat surfaces, where the peel-off force strongly depends on the peeling direction. Our analysis also reveals that in the large roughness regime the peel-off force achieves its theoretical upper bound, irrespective of the other particulars of the substrate's surface profile.

  title={Effect of machine stiffness on interpreting contact force--indentation depth curves in adhesive elastic contact experiments},
  author={Deng, Weilin and Kesari, Haneesh},
  abstract={
    Dry adhesion plays a critical role in many fields, including the locomotion of some insects and failure of microelectromechanical systems. The Dupr{\'e}'s work of adhesion of a contact interface is an important metric of dry adhesion. It is often measured by applying the Johnson--Kendall--Roberts (JKR) theory [1] to contact force--indentation depth curves that are measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM), or an instrument modeled after it. The JKR theory has been exceptionally successful in interpreting contact force--indentation depth measurements and explaining adhesive, elastic contact phenomena, such as the pull-in and pull-off instabilities. However, in many cases the JKR theory predicts a lower magnitude for the pull-off force than what is experimentally measured, and it does not capture the finite changes in the indentation depth that occur during the pull-in and pull-off instabilities. In those cases, applying the JKR theory to calculate the work of adhesion from only the measured pull-off force is likely to give highly inaccurate results. We believe that these discrepancies occur because the classical JKR theory ignores the machine stiffness---which, in the case of AFM-type instruments, is the stiffness of the mechanical structure that connects the tip to the translation stage, which moves the tip towards and away from the substrate. In this paper, we present a model that is related to, but more general than, the JKR theory that accounts for the machine stiffness. This model explains the experimental data better than the JKR theory in the cases where the JKR theory displays the aforementioned discrepancies. We consider both the first order necessary and the higher order sufficiency conditions while deriving the solutions in our model.

  title={Depth-dependent hysteresis in adhesive elastic contacts at large surface roughness},
  author={Deng, Weilin and Kesari, Haneesh},
  abstract={
    Contact force–indentation depth measurements in contact experiments involving compliant materials, such as polymers and gels, show a hysteresis loop whose size depends on the maximum indentation depth. This depth-dependent hysteresis (DDH) is not explained by classical contact mechanics theories and was believed to be due to effects such as material viscoelasticity, plasticity, surface polymer interdigitation, and moisture. It has been observed that the DDH energy loss initially increases and then decreases with roughness. A mechanics model based on the occurrence of adhesion and roughness related small-scale instabilities was presented by one of the authors for explaining DDH. However, that model only applies in the regime of infinitesimally small surface roughness, and consequently it does not capture the decrease in energy loss with surface roughness at the large roughness regime. We present a new mechanics model that applies in the regime of large surface roughness based on the Maugis--Dugdale theory of adhesive elastic contacts and Nayak's theory of rough surfaces. The model captures the trend of decreasing energy loss with increasing roughness. It also captures the experimentally observed dependencies of energy loss on the maximum indentation depth, and material and surface properties.

  title={Molecular statics study of depth-dependent hysteresis in nano-scale adhesive elastic contacts},
  author={Deng, Weilin and Kesari, Haneesh},
  abstract={
    The contact force--indentation-depth ($P$--$h$) measurements in adhesive contact experiments, such as atomic force microscopy, display hysteresis. In some cases, the amount of hysteretic energy loss is found to depend on the maximum indentation-depth. This depth-dependent hysteresis (DDH) is not explained by classical contact theories, such as Johnson--Kendall--Roberts and Derjaguin--Muller--Toporov, and is often attributed to surface moisture, material viscoelasticity, and plasticity. We present molecular statics simulations that are devoid of these mechanisms, yet still capture DDH. In our simulations, DDH is due to a series of surface mechanical instabilities. Surface features, such as depressions or protrusions, can temporarily arrest the growth or recession of the contact area. With a sufficiently large change of indentation-depth, the contact area grows or recedes abruptly by a finite amount and dissipates energy. This is similar to the pull-in and pull-off instabilities in classical contact theories, except that in this case the number of instabilities depends on the roughness of the contact surface. Larger maximum indentation-depths result in more surface features participating in the load–unload process, resulting in larger hysteretic energy losses. This mechanism is similar to the one recently proposed by one of the authors using a continuum mechanics-based model. However, that model predicts that the hysteretic energy loss always increases with roughness, whereas experimentally it is found that the hysteretic energy loss initially increases but then later decreases with roughness. Our simulations capture this non-monotonic dependence of hysteretic energy loss on roughness.

  abstract={
    The multi-scale deformation and interfacial mechanical behavior of carbon nanotube fibers with multi-level structures are investigated by experimental and theoretical methods. Multi-scale experiments including uniaxial tensile testing, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy are conducted to measure the mechanical response of multi-level structures within the fiber under tension. A two-level interfacial mechanical model is then presented to analyze the interfacial bonding strength of mesoscopic bundles and microscopic nanotubes. The evolution characteristics of multi-scale deformation of the fiber are described based on experimental characterization and interfacial strength analysis. The strengthening mechanism of the fiber is further studied. Comprehensive analysis shows that the property of multi-level interfaces is a critical factor for the fiber strength and toughness. Finally, the method of improving the mechanical properties of fiber-based materials is discussed. The result can be used to guide multi-level interface engineering of carbon nanotube fibers and fiber-based composites to produce high performance materials.

  abstract={
    A strain sensor composed of carbon nanotubes with Raman spectroscopy can achieve measurement of the three in-plane strain components in microscale. Based on previous work on the mathematic model of carbon nanotube strain sensors, this paper presents a detailed study on the optimization, diversification, and standardization of a CNT strain sensor from the viewpoint of metrology. A new miniaccessory for polarization control is designed, and two different preparing methods for CNT films as sensing media are introduced to provide diversified choices for applications. Then, the standard procedure of creating CNT strain sensors is proposed. Application experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the above improvement, which is helpful in developing this method for convenient metrology.

  abstract={
    We present a Raman spectroscopy study on a film of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) acting as a wireless sensor for measuring strain at the microscale. A model for the CNT strain sensor was proposed by evaluating the quantitative contributions of individual deformed CNTs to the entire Raman spectrum. The proposed model provides an analytical relationship between the in-plane strain components to be measured and the spectral parameters detected directly through polarized Raman tests on the CNT film sensor. Based on this model, a noncontact technique for strain measurements is developed. The experiments using this technique confirmed that the CNT strain sensor described is appropriate for measuring the in-plane strain components at the microscale by using polarized Raman spectroscopy.

  abstract={
    Deformation mechanisms of carbon nanotube (CNT) fibres under tensile loading are studied by means of in situ Raman spectroscopy to detect the CNT deformation and stress distributions in the fibres. The G' band in the Raman spectrum responds distinctly to the tensile stress in Raman shift, width and intensity. The G' band changes with the tensile deformation of the fibre at different stages, namely elastic deformation, strengthening and damage–fracture. It is deduced that the individual CNTs only deform elastically without obvious damage or bond breaking. The yield and fracture of fibres can be due to the slippage among the CNTs.
