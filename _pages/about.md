I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate
of Solid Mechanics Group
in the [School of Engineering](https://www.brown.edu/academics/engineering){:target="_blank"}
at Brown University.
I received my Ph.D. in Solid Mechanics in August 2019, from Brown University.
My Ph.D. advisor was [Haneesh Kesari](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/hkesari){:target="_blank"}.
My research is focused on fundamental understanding of adhesive [contact mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_mechanics){:target="_blank"} at the micro- and nano-scales and its applications in [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy){:target="_blank"} and [biological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_setae){:target="_blank"} systems.
It involves theoretical modeling and numerical analysis of adhesive elastic and viscoelastic contacts between solids with rough surfaces.
I am also interested in adhesion and instability of soft materials.


Prior to Brown, I obtained my B.Eng. in Engineering Mechanics in July 2010
and M.Eng. in Solid Mechanics in January 2013, both from Tianjin University, China, with Outstanding Graduate Award. 
My master study was on experimental investigation of the multi-scale deformation mechanism of carbon nanotube fiber.

Outside the office, I like reading, badminton, photography, and hiking.
